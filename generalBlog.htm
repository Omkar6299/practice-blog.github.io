        Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface?
        While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of
        effort and skill that goes into making a website attractive and user-friendly. The
        secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of front-end development,
        and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get
        better in front-end design and web development.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Automate!</h3>
            <p>
                As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little
                details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time
                on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency management,
                performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound
                easy, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow.
                While automation can take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc.,
                you can focus on the core areas of front-end development such as HTML, CSS,
                creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on.
                By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn
                to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality
                of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.

            <h3>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h3>
            <p>
                By “refactoring” your code, you're only enhancing the code without
                tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and
                readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your
                code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of
                what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages
                that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from
                plagiarism.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning Command Line Is The Way To Go.</h3>
            <p>
                It is a standard convention among developers to use GUI tools to power the
                terminal. What most of them don’t realize is that by doing so, they end up
                spending a significant portion of their valuable time in handling GUI tools
                than making progress on the terminal. The right way to go about it is
                learning the command line. Start with the basics of the command line and
                advance to higher levels as you go, and you’ll find that you can complete
                several tasks with much more ease and efficiency with command line tools
                than with GUI tools. Moreover, automating the terminal with appropriate
                commands is a great way to save time and energy.

            <p>

                add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available now is massive!
